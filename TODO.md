- .ORG FAQ PAGE!?
- Shared `/components` need to have theme style vars passed in from each site
  independently somehow. `theme.css` global what to do?
- List status of known out-of-date or custom package in readme
- remind not to do bad SEO links like this: "so to see the stuff, click <here>."
- html tag presize images w/simple fillers for quick loading and
  no resizing on mobile
- describe: numenta.com has default/shared/global components, .org starts
  splitting off customs.
- mention that PDF, Doc/x, TXT should be in `static/resources/`, as everything
  in `pages/` needs to be able to lose filename during webpack transpilation.

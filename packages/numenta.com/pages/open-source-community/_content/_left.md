Because we want our technology to be broadly adopted, we make it widely
accessible in an open source community. There you’ll find our algorithms, daily
research, source code, and an active discussion forum with HTM community members
covering a variety of topics.

You’ll also find our implementation of HTM theory, called NuPIC (Numenta
Platform for Intelligent Computing), which is written in C++ and Python. Other
implementations have been ported from NuPIC into other languages by community
members.

If you are interested in seeing, developing or working with our technology, we
invite you to participate at http://numenta.org/.

Anyone is welcome to use our technology for free, under
the [AGPLv3 open source license][license]. In addition, we have created a
separate, [trial license without commercial rights][trial] for those individuals
or organizations who are unable to use the AGPLv3 license. For more on our
licenses, see the [Business Strategy & IP][business] section.

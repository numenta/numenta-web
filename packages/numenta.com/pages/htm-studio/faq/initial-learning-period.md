title: What is the initial learning period?
---

HTM Studio begins to build models from the metric in your data immediately.
During the initial learning period, the anomaly results are displayed as grey
bars with the value “N/A” displayed in the chart area. Once a HTM model
has enough data points to learn on, it will display anomalies indicated by
green, yellow and red bars.

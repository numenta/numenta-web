title: "Brain Theory in AI - Inspiration or Direction?"
type: post

I recently wrote a guest Industry Perspectives post for insideBIGDATA titled,
“The Importance of Brain Theory in True Machine Intelligence.”  In this piece, I
was asked to explore various questions, including what is machine intelligence
technology based on neocortical theory, why is it important, how and why does it
work, and where will it take us?

These are obviously questions that we think about every day here at Numenta, but
for many people, a biological approach to machine intelligence is a new concept.
I was reminded of this at a social event recently, where I engaged in the
typical, “What do you do?” banter.  When I began to talk about Numenta and our
goal of figuring out how the brain learns, I was immediately interrupted with
questions: *Are you building a brain?* (No.) *Building a robot based on the
brain?* (No.) *Aren’t you afraid smart machines will take over the world?* (No.)  

Once the typical questions ended, the conversation shifted to brains and brain
theory.  It was with this conversation in mind that I wrote the piece and posed
this question:  

> *In the field of artificial intelligence, should the brain serve as
  inspiration or roadmap?*

How would you answer this question?  To see my thoughts on it, you can read the

### Numenta Newsletter

**May 14, 2015**

Dear Numenta newsletter subscriber:

I am excited to let you know that we recently announced a relationship with
Cortical.io, an innovative company based
in Austria that is working on the next generation of natural language
processing: language intelligence. Cortical.io has created a technology that can
translate text into sparse distributed representations, called Semantic Folding.
By using Cortical.ioâ€™s Semantic Folding technology in combination with HTM, we
plan to tackle problems in language that have frustrated computer scientists for
many years. To learn more about Cortical.io, you can read our
[press release](/press/2015/05/14/numenta-and-cortical-io-form-strategic-partnership/),
view the Cortical.io [website](http://cortical.io/), or try the Cortical.io API
at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=c88ca878-a648-464c-b29b-38ba057bd2f5).

I also wanted to draw your attention to a new paper about HTM written by
Sebastian Billaudelle, with Subutai Ahmad, our VP Research. As part of the
European based Human Brain Project, Sebastian spent several months at Numenta
porting HTM to the Heidelberg Neuromorphic Computing Platform, with positive
results. Sebastian implemented HTM using spiking neurons, which are complex
models often used by neuroscientists to reproduce actual biophysical
characteristics of neurons. You can read about his work [here](/papers/).

We have several great projects under development and look forward to sharing
more with you over the coming months.

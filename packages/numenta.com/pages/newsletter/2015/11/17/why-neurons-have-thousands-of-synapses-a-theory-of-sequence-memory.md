#### Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex

Hello Numenta newsletter subscribers! November is shaping up to be a busy and
exciting month for Numenta.
[Earlier this month](/newsletter/2015/11/10/numenta-anomaly-benchmark-nab-open-source-with-white-paper/),
I wrote you about the release of our Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB). Today I’m
pleased to share more good news.

Numenta founders Jeff Hawkins and Subutai Ahmad have written a paper that we
believe will become a seminal work in the field of biological and machine
intelligence. It is titled, “Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of
Sequence Memory in Neocortex.”  We posted the paper to an academic archive a
couple of weeks ago. This makes it available while it is undergoing the peer
review process.

MIT Technology Review noticed and wrote a thoughtful article about the paper
that explains the concepts and their importance in a very understandable way. We
thought we’d share both the MIT Technology Review article and our paper. If you
are interested in Numenta, brain theory, and machine intelligence I think you
will be interested in reading them.

### Newsletter - January 26, 2015

**Welcome to 2015!**

As a fun and educational kick-off to the year, we are offering our second
**Super Bowl sparse football pool**.  Entering the pool is free, and prizes are
offered for the top five winners (note that because of legal constraints, those
people under 18 or outside of the U.S. cannot win prizes â€¦ but they still can
play for the glory of winning!).  Participating is a fun way to learn more about
Sparse Distributed Representations. Subutai explains here the details of the
pool:

In early January, we delivered **NuPIC version 0.1**, our
[first formal release](http://numenta.org/news/2015/01/22/nupic-0.1-released.html)
of NuPIC.  Says Matt Taylor, our NuPIC flag-bearer, "With the NuPIC 0.1 release,
most OS X and Linux users won't need to compile from source code to install.
This makes the installation process much easier for those wanting to use NuPIC
as a python project."

In other news, we look forward to an exciting year at Numenta.  We are beginning
the hard work of publishing more information on our algorithms, including
submissions for peer reviewed papers.  We are progressing in the science with a
lot of focus on sensory-motor integration.  For those interested in the details,
the concepts are often discussed in the
[HTM Community](https://discourse.numenta.org) and in
[NuPIC office hours](http://numenta.org/events/). We are continuing to
support our product, [Grok](http://grokstream.com), and have an additional
demonstration application in the works to announce later this year. We also
will be speaking or exhibiting at a number of events this year, including:

* [Strata + Hadoop World](/events/2015/02/17/strata-hadoop-world/),
  2/20, Subutai (VP of Research) will give a talk on streaming analytics

We are also planning a **Spring NuPIC Hackathon**, which we expect to be on the
U.S. East Coast.  Be sure to follow us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Numenta?lang=en) and check our
[events page](/events/) as more speaking appearances or events are announced.

You might enjoy seeing a [short video](http://youtu.be/f1tYXv6ST_U) featuring
Jeff that describes our mission. In an effort to communicate more about our
work, you can expect to see more material like this over the coming year.

Best wishes for a happy new year!

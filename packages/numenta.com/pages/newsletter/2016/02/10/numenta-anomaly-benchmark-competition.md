### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; February 10, 2016

I’m excited to update you on what’s happening at Numenta this month, but before
I do, I want to introduce myself, as some of you may notice a new name at the
bottom of this newsletter. I joined Numenta as the Director of Marketing last
fall, and I look forward to keeping you up to date on the latest Numenta news.

This month, I am pleased to announce the
[Numenta Anomaly Benchmark competition](http://numenta.org/nab/),
offered in conjunction with the
[IEEE WCCI (World Congress on Computational Intelligence)](http://www.wcci2016.org/programs.php?id=home).
This contest follows the release last fall of our
[Numenta Anomaly Benchmark](/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/),
which is designed to test algorithms that detect anomalies in
streaming data and reward early detection.

The competition provides cash awards for two categories: algorithms and
datasets.  In the algorithms category, we’re looking for others to test and
publish results of running anomaly detection algorithms on NAB.  For the dataset
category, we’re looking for real-world, time-series data with labeled anomalies.
Winning entrants that are participating in the WCCI contest will be announced
during official conference proceedings.  We are offering a parallel contest for
those who are not able to attend the conference.  We’ll award cash prizes for
the same two categories.  All contest entries are due by July 1, 2016, but we
encourage you to submit early. For more details on the NAB competition, visit
http://numenta.org/nab/. Our intention with NAB is to create a community around
it and grow it into a widely used tool.  We hope the competition will be a fun
way to add to the benchmark corpus and to position NAB as the standard benchmark
for anomaly detection in streaming data.

In other news, we recently shared a summary of our published and submitted
research papers.  You can now access all of these papers at
[http://numenta.com/papers/](/papers/). I encourage you to bookmark the page as
we will be updating it with new material throughout the year.

Lastly, I want to share that we will be participating in
[Strata San Jose](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca),
March 29-31. We’ll have a booth on the expo floor where you can meet our
engineers and see our demonstration applications. We’ll also preview a new tool
to enable broader experimentation with HTM, so stay tuned for more details.
If you’re planning on attending Strata, please stop by and see us.

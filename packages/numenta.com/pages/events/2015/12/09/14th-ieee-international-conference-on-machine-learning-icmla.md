### IEEE ICMLA'15

#### 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications

The 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (IEEE
ICMLA'15) will be held in Miami, Florida, USA, December, 2015.

The aim of the conference is to bring researchers working in the areas of
machine learning and applications together. The conference will cover both
theoretical and experimental research results. Submission of machine learning
papers describing machine learning applications in fields like medicine,
biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments,
game playing and problem solving is strongly encouraged.

Conference content will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore as well as
other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.

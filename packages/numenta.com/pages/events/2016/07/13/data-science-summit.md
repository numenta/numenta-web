### Topic

At Numenta we aim to understand the computational principles underlying the
neocortex, and build intelligent machines based on those principles. At its most
basic level the neocortex takes in a stream of sensory data, builds a
sensorimotor model of the world and outputs a stream of motor actions. Recent
advances in neuroscience and neural imaging techniques have led to an explosion
of data and information regarding these functions. In this talk I will describe
a number of cortical principles and how, as computer scientists, we can
translate them into working systems. The core ideas have been validated in
commercial streaming analytics applications, and an optimized implementation is
available in our open source project called NuPIC. Although we still have much
work to do, this work forms a foundation for building biologically inspired
intelligent machines.

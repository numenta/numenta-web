## Event Details

#### Spotlight on molecules, structure, and function

Dendrites are thin processes extending from the cell bodies of multiple neuron
types. Since the majority of synaptic connections take place on dendrites, they
provide the primary substrate for inter-neuronal communication. In addition to
their role as conducting cables, the dendrites of many neuron types contain a
rich repertoire of ionic mechanisms that allow them to perform all sorts of
nonlinear computations. As a result, dendrites have been suggested to play a key
role in information processing in brain and may even serve as independent
processing units. This Workshop brings together scientific leaders from around
the world to present their work on molecular, biophysical, anatomical and/or
functional studies in dendrites, aiming to further our understanding of how
these beautiful structures contribute to different brain functions.

With the backdrop of an informal yet spectacular setting on the Greek island of
Crete, the meeting has been carefully planned to not only satisfy our scientific
curiosity but also foster discussion and encourage interaction between attendees
well beyond the traditional presentations. In this spirit, the workshop will
also provide soft skills sessions for all participants.

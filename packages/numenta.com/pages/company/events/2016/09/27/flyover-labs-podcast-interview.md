### About Podcast

This is a great interview with Celeste Baranski. Celeste is the Vice President
of Engineering at Numenta. Numenta is a small company with an interesting dual
mission: to reverse engineer the neocortex, and then apply these neocortical
principles to create intelligent machines. Numenta does basic neuroscience
research and technology development, all of which is available in the
opensource.

Celeste has a varied engineering background, from managing large teams to
helping startups innovate as a designer.

We talk about what Numenta is working on, how Numenta is structured and
Celeste’s role. Here are some other things we talk about:

* How does Numenta develop its technology?
* What kinds of things can Numenta’s technology do today?
* In 5 years what type of problems could Numenta be solving?

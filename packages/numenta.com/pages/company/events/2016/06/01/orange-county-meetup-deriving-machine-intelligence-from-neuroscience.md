title: OC Meetup - Deriving Machine Intelligence from Neuroscience
type: post
---

#### Hosted by: OC Deep Learning, HTM, ANN, NLP & AI Meetup.

Alex will be presenting via webinar and his company Numenta who's a leader in
this new era of machine intelligence is kind enough to be sending us some
materials and giveaways so we will be able to share in some first hand data
coming from this exciting field of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) which is
detailed computational theory based on the neocortex.

This will be an interactive webinar for those that can not make it in person.
See event page to sign-up to attend in person, or via webinar.

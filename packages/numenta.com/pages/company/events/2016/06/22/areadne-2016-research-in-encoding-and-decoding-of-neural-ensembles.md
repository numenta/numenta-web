### Event Details

There are three major goals of the AREADNE Conferences. First and foremost, the
meetings are intended to gather global scientific leaders who work on neural
ensembles and create a touch-point for a widely disparate and hybrid field.
Second, with a spectacular setting on Santorini, the conferences have been
carefully planned to foster discussion and interaction between attendees to
encourage the establishment of lasting professional relationships. Third, these
meetings continue our efforts to promote systems neuroscience in Greece through
creating a world-class forum for cutting-edge research.

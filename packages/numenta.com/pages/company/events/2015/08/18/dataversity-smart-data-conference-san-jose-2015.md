### Opening Keynote

Come see Subutai Ahmad, VP of Research for Numenta, speak on how cognitive
computing will drive the future of analytics.

* Wednesday, August 19, 2015
* 09:00 AM - 09:30 AM
* Level: 	Business/Strategic

### Topic

> *We are witnessing an explosion of sensors and machine generated data. Every
  server, every building, and every device generates a continuous stream of
  information that is ever changing and potentially valuable. The existing big
  data paradigm requires storing data for batch analysis, and extensive modeling
  by a human expert, prior to deployment. This is incredibly inefficient and
  cannot scale. Instead there is a growing need to rapidly create adaptive
  models that accept streaming data sources and can take instant action.*

> *In this talk I will describe a new paradigm for streaming data algorithms,
  based on recent neuroscience findings and on the computational properties of
  the neocortex. These systems are highly automated, adapt to changing
  statistics, and naturally deal with temporal data streams. They require no
  batch training and custom models can be deployed on the fly. Many of the core
  ideas have been implemented in the open source project NuPIC, and validated in
  commercial applications. Given the massive increase in the number of data
  sources, a general-purpose automated approach is the only scalable way to
  effectively analyze and act on continuously streaming information.*

### About the Speaker

Subutai Ahmad is the VP of Research at Numenta, a company focused on Machine
Intelligence. Our technology, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), is a detailed
computational framework based on principles of the brain. Our HTM learning
algorithms are available through the NuPIC open source community and are
embedded in our commercial streaming analytics applications.

Subutaiâ€™s experience includes computational neuroscience, machine learning,
computer vision and building real time commercial systems. He has previously
served as VP Engineering at YesVideo where he helped grow the company from a
three-person start-up to a leader in automated digital media authoring. In 1997,
Subutai co-founded ePlanet Interactive, a spin-off from Interval Research.
ePlanet developed the IntelPlay Me2Cam, the first computer vision product
developed for consumers.

Subutai holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Cornell, and a Ph.D in Computer
Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

### Meet Numenta

The Numenta team would love to meet you, answer any questions about our HTM
technology, discuss cognitive computing, and show you around our intelligent
applications.

Open Hours:
* Tue Aug 18: 4:00pm - 6:30pm
* Wed Aug 19: 2:15pm - 8:00pm

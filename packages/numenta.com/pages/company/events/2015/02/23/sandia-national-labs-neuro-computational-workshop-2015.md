#### Beyond von Neumann/Turing Architecture and Moore’s Law Limits

Conventional, stored program architecture systems are designed for algorithmic
and exact calculations.  However, the problems with highest impact involve
large, noisy, incomplete, “natural” data sets that do not lend themselves to
convenient solutions by current systems.  Our task is to build upon the
convergence – cresting waves among neuroscience, microelectronics and
computational systems to develop a new architecture designed to handle these
natural data sets.

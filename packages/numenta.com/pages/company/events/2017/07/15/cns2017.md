## Summary

Subutai Ahmad, Numenta VP of Research, will present a poster, oral presentation and workshop at this event.

**Sunday, July 16 16:00-19:00<br/>
Poster: A cortical model for learning complex temporal structure in sensory streams**

**Tuesday, July 18 10:40-11:00<br/>
Talk: Learning structure of 3D objects with cortical columns**

In this talk, Subutai will describe a model in which how cortical columns learn 3D sensorimotor models of the world by combining sensory inputs with allocentric location and how cross-columnar connections allow faster inference. This detailed model is consistent with anatomical and physiological evidence.

**Thursday, July 20 16:00-16:45<br/>
Workshop: Cortical Function: Towards Understanding and Developing Integrative Theories**

Subutai will be a presenter in the workshop, “Cortical Function: Towards Understanding and Developing Integrative Theories”.  Subutai’s presentation,  “Why Do Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses? A Theory of Sequence Learning in Neocortex," will be based on the content in our peer-reviewed paper by the same name.

## About the Event

The International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will provide a forum 
for researchers to discuss current mathematical innovations emerging in
neuroscience. A major aim of the conference is to attract and train young 
researchers on current methods in mathematical neuroscience. To fulfill this 
goal, we will hold a tutorial the day before the main meeting. The main 
conference will feature a broader set of topics in mathematical neuroscience, 
with a focus on (a) the use of experimental data in modeling studies; (b) theory 
and models that explore hypotheses and design better experiments; (c\) improved 
methods for analyzing complex data sets; and (d) rigorous mathematical models of 
neural systems.

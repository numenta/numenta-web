The Research Group at Numenta is looking for outstanding PhD students or other
research scientists for internship opportunities during the Winter 2017/2018 and
Spring/Summer 2018 time frames. We are looking for candidates with
expertise in Computational Neuroscience or Machine Learning. Preference given to
candidates with experience in one or more of the following areas: sequence
learning, sensorimotor inference, neuron/dendrite modeling, goal oriented
behavior, and detailed computational models of cortex.

The commitment is for 3 to 4 months full time (longer appointments up to one
year may be possible). Numenta’s research interns will get exposure to all
aspects of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) learning algorithms, participate
in leading edge research in computational neuroscience, and get full clearance
to publish their work.


### What You Can Expect to Learn and How You Might Contribute

* The challenges of designing and implementing detailed models of cortical
  function that can be applied to real-world problems.

* Gain experience solving hard problems in domains such as streaming analytics
  and/or sensorimotor inference.

* Participate in designing functional models of Layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6,
  thalamocortical circuits, feedback circuits, and sensorimotor processing.

* Learn how to contribute to a top open source project, and improve your
  software engineering skills.

* Obtain a detailed understanding of Hierarchical Temporal Memory.


### Desired Qualifications

* Currently enrolled in a MS or PhD program, or a recent graduate, or equivalent
  research experience.

* Strong research background in machine learning or machine intelligence.

* Strong research background in computational neuroscience.

* Excellent algorithmic problem solving skills, and the ability to implement
  solutions in Python, C/C++, Java, etc.

* Established track record of publications in leading peer reviewed conferences
  and journals.

* Working knowledge of HTM algorithms a plus.

* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to work in
  a team oriented environment.

* A belief that the best way to build intelligent machines is to understand the
  cortex.


### How To Apply

Qualified applicants should send the following:

* Cover letter describing their specific interest in Numenta.

* Resume, including list of relevant course work and a link to your github
  repository or other public code repository that contains code you have
  worked on.

* Period of the internship (typically 3 to 4 months full time).

* Please email resume and cover letter to
  [interns@numenta.com](mailto:interns@numenta.com). Numenta is an equal
  opportunity employer supporting workforce diversity.

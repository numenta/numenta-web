### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; December 19, 2016

As 2016 comes to a close, I’m sure many of you are reflecting on this past year
as you also look ahead to the next one.  I found myself doing the same when I
sat down with our co-founder Jeff Hawkins recently.  I asked him to share his
thoughts on Numenta’s 2016 highlights and what he’s most looking forward to
in 2017.  Jeff talked about the progress we’ve made on our dual missions of
reverse engineering the neocortex and creating machine learning technology based
on how the brain learns.  From the [peer-reviewed papers][1] and
[research collaborations][2] the growth of the [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark][3]
and the release of [HTM Studio][4] – it’s been a busy year, but as Jeff’s
excitement indicates, the best may be yet to come. You can view my full
conversation with him below.

Our partners have been busy as well. [Grok][5] returned from a successful AWS
re:invent where they announced new product features designed to make it even
easier for businesses to get up and running with Grok.  You can read about the
new sources and integrations galleries in this [blog post][6].

[Cortical.io][7] co-founder Francisco Webber has been speaking at several
events, including [AI Europe][8] in London and Data Natives in Berlin. You can
see a video of his talk from the latter event [here][9]. Cortical.io will be in
the Bay Area next month at the [Deep Learning Summit][10], but for those who
can’t catch them in person, you can explore their technology through their
latest [similarity explorer demo][11] – a tool that compares the meaning of any
two pieces of text by overlaying their semantic fingerprints.

Numenta has a couple events lined up for January as well. Research engineer
Yuwei Cui will be giving a talk titled “Real-Time Streaming Data Analysis with
HTM” at the [Global AI Data Science Conference 2017][12] in Santa Clara, CA.  
Scott Purdy will present “How to Model Streaming Data That You Know Nothing
About” at [Smart Data 2017][13] in Redwood City, CA. We will also have a booth
at this event, so if you’re planning to attend, be sure to come see us.

Thank you for continuing to follow Numenta, and I look forward to sharing more
news with you in 2017.  Have a wonderful holiday season and Happy New Year.

I’m writing to let you know that we have two upcoming opportunities to learn
about and try our technology:

### Numenta Training Workshop

* Friday, Oct 17 2014, 12pm - 6pm
* Redwood City, CA

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/numenta-training-workshop-registration-12898835765

This half-day workshop for developers will review Numenta theory, technology and
applications. Content will consist of presentations about HTM theory, including
some detailed implementation topics, and will be technical in nature.  The
workshop will be followed by a networking reception.  If you have been
interested in our work and have wanted to get a thorough grounding in the
subject matter, or if you already are active in our community but would like an
update on our progress, attending this workshop is a great idea.  Our capacity
is limited, and early-bird pricing is available through September 26th, so we
encourage you to register soon.

### Numenta Fall NuPIC Hackathon

* Saturday, Oct 18 2014 - Sunday, Oct 19 2014
* San Jose, CA

http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/202402962/

The NuPIC fall hackathon follows our workshop and will be a 32-hour all-weekend
hackathon. We'll start with a kickoff presentation from the NuPIC team,
including a few words from Jeff Hawkins. During the event, we'll help you get
NuPIC installed and provide several informational sessions about NuPIC. The
event will end with demonstrations of hacks that attendees have created during
the event.
([See example of past demos here](http://numenta.org/blog/2014/05/09/2014-spring-hackathon-outcome.html#demos)).
The hackathon is appropriate both for experienced NuPIC developers as well as
for new developers.

I hope you’ve had a chance to check out our updated web site, where we have
released some new whitepapers, including an expanded version of
[The Science of Anomaly Detection](/resources/papers/).

I look forward to seeing many of you at the Workshop and/or the Hackathon.
Thank you for your ongoing interest in Numenta.

### Numenta Newsletter

**June 09, 2015**

Dear Numenta newsletter subscriber:

Iâ€™m writing to update you on exciting news for our open source project, NuPIC.

In order to encourage our developers and to facilitate the creation of
applications, we have decided to release substantially more of our technology
into open source. To that end, we just added to the code base two complete
products: Grok for IT Analytics and HTM for Stocks (an example application
that will be made available to end users shortly). The released code for these
products includes the HTM Engine as well as two different Android applications.
The HTM Engine runs multiple anomaly models in an easy, scalable way, allowing a
single server to manage and run thousands of HTM models. The Android
applications act as a client to the HTM engine, pulling in the data to display
it in a human-understandable format. We are developing tutorials that will help
developers come up to speed on this new technology.

This source code has been open-sourced under the AGPLv3.0 license<sup>\*</sup>.
You can find all the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps).

We hope that developers will find this source code beneficial as example
applications of NuPIC. If you are interested in creating a commercial
application using this code, you may do so in accordance with the terms of the
AGPLv3<sup>\*</sup>, or may [write us](mailto:sales@numenta.com) to request a
separate, commercial license if you prefer different terms. Commercial licenses
are handled on a case-by-case basis. For more information on our open source

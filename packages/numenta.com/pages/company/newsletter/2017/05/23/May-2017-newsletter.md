I am pleased to share that several of our employees will be speaking at
upcoming events across the country over the next couple of months. These
events will target a broad range of audiences, from neuroscientists to
data scientists to AI enthusiasts.


On June 18, Senior Engineer Austin Marshall will deliver a special session
on “The importance of brain theory in creating intelligent systems” at the 2017
54th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) in Austin, TX. Austin
will present details and working principles of HTMs before discussing how we
can apply brain theory today and where it will take us tomorrow.

 
On June 28, Open Source Community Manager [Matt Taylor](https://twitter.com/rhyolight)
will give a talk on “The Biological Path Towards Strong AI” at the
[O’Reilly AI Conference](/company/events/2017/06/28/oreilly-nyc/) in Manhattan, NY.
His talk will feature detailed, dynamic visualizations of foundational
algorithms of the neocortex. Matt uses these visualizations to demonstrate how
systems with a biologically accurate neuron model are likely to yield strong AI.
Also speaking at this conference is [Francisco Webber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscoeduardodesousawebber/?ppe=1),
co-founder of our strategic partner [Cortical.io](http://www.cortical.io).
Francisco’s [session](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/59280),
“AI-powered natural language understanding applications in the financial
industry,” will show how Cortical<!---->.io’s semantic folding technique helps
financial companies meet increased regulatory requirements by automating use
cases that involve analyzing large amounts of text.


Research Engineer [Yuwei Cui](https://twitter.com/ywcui) will be one of two
speakers at the [SF Big Analytics Meetup](/company/events/2017/07/06/sf-big-analytics/)
on July 6. His talk, “What the brain tells us about the future of streaming
analytics,” will cover how HTM not only advances our understanding of how the
brain may solve sequence learning problems, but also how it’s applicable to
real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams. Yuwei will
also give an in-depth biological talk titled “Presence of high order cell
assemblies in mouse visual cortices during natural movie stimulation” at the
[International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience](/company/events/2017/06/01/icmns/)
on June 1 in Boulder, CO. This talk is based on work done in conjunction with
Professor Spencer Smith at the [Neuroscience Center at the University of North Carolina](https://www.med.unc.edu/neuroscience),
which [Yuwei blogged about last year](/blog/2016/12/09/visit-to-neuroscience-labs-at-mpfi-and-unc/).


Speaking of Cortical.io, we were thrilled to learn that the company was recently
named a Cool Vendor in [Gartner’s Cool Vendors in AI Core Technologies, 2017](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3714236).
One of five companies in the report, Cortical.io was recognized for its
innovative solution. We congratulate the Cortical.io team on this significant
recognition.\*


In other partner news, [Grok](http://www.grokstream.com) published a [new whitepaper](http://wp.grokstream.com/aiops)
articulating the company’s vision to help enterprise organizations build an
AIOps strategy. Coined by Gartner, AIOps is an emerging set of processes, tools
and best practices around algorithmic IT operations. In this paper, Grok
discusses the merits of building an AIOps solution, and the advantages of using
Grok’s self-healing platform to respond to IT incidents before they lead to
application downtime. Grok is holding a webinar on June 6th for people interested
in hearing more. Reserve your spot [here](http://event.grokstream.com/webinar-aiops).


Lastly, we recently made another major update to our living book, [Biological and Machine Intelligence](/resources/biological-and-machine-intelligence/).
The Problem Sets chapter now contains questions spanning the SDRs, Encoders,
Spatial Pooling and Temporal Memory chapters. Keep sending us your [comments and questions](https://numenta.wufoo.com/forms/biological-and-machine-intelligence-bami/)
about BAMI, and don’t forget to follow [@NumentaBAMI](https://twitter.com/NumentaBAMI)

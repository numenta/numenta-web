REDWOOD CITY, CA –August 19, 2015— [Numenta, Inc.](/), a leader in machine
intelligence, today announced a strategic partnership with
[Avik Partners](http://www.grokstream.com/), a new IT services and advanced
analytics company, for its Grok for IT Analytics on AWS technology. The
announcement was made during the
[Smart Data Conference](http://smartdata2015.dataversity.net) being held in
San Jose, CA. (See Numenta at Booth #406).

Grok for IT Analytics on AWS detects anomalies in Amazon Web Services server
metrics and is currently available at http://grokstream.com.
As part of this strategic relationship, Numenta will transfer the Grok
application and the Grok brand to Avik under a broad general licensing agreement
for Numenta’s [Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)](/papers-videos-and-more/)
technology. Numenta also will take a minority ownership position in Avik.

“Our core HTM technology can be applied to such a broad array of machine
intelligence solutions, it would be impossible for us to pursue
commercialization in all of these verticals. We decided that the best approach
for us, like that taken by premier research institutions, is a licensing and
technology transfer model. It is an exciting way for us to see our HTM
applications built out for commercial use,” said Numenta CEO Donna Dubinsky.  

She added, “In Casey Kindiger, the CEO of Avik, we found the perfect match to
take Grok for IT Analytics and run with it. He is a proven entrepreneur who is
starting this new venture to apply HTM technology to solve problems in IT
analytics.”

Kindiger, a veteran enterprise software solutions provider and consultant,
founded Avik after more than a decade of designing and developing process
automation solutions for companies like JP Morgan Chase, T-Mobile, Allstate
Insurance, and others.

“HTM offers substantially better technology for finding anomalies and is well
suited to the needs of today’s streaming data in IT and dev ops environments,”
said Kindiger. “We are very excited to be able to take the Grok technology and
brand, move it forward and build on it.”

During the past two years, Numenta has created a series of example applications
to illustrate the capabilities of HTM, beginning with Grok for IT Analytics on
AWS. The HTM technology also has been applied to anomaly detection in stock
prices and volumes
([HTM for Stocks](/htm-for-stocks/)),
human behavior, geo-spatial tracking data, and to the predication and
classification of natural language. For the latter application, Numenta recently
announced a partnership and licensing agreement with
[Cortical.io](/press/2015/05/14/numenta-and-cortical-io-form-strategic-partnership/),
an innovator in natural language processing (NLP), to license HTM and use the
technology for the development of language intelligence products.

“We will continue to create example applications to inspire others, and hope to
create a constellation of partnerships like Avik and Cortical.io going forward
to enable broad commercialization of HTM technology,” Dubinsky concluded.

Numenta, Inc. was founded in 2005 to be a leader in the emerging field of
machine intelligence. Numenta builds technology that helps companies
automatically and intelligently act on machine generated data.  Its biologically
inspired machine learning technology is based on a theory of the neocortex first
described in co-founder Jeff Hawkins’ book, On Intelligence. In addition,
Numenta has created NuPIC (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing) as an
open source project (http://numenta.org).  Numenta is based in Redwood City,
California.

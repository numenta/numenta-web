Numenta, a leading provider of solutions
that help companies intelligently act on machine-generated data, today announced
its Grok solution has achieved certified integration with the SAP® Sybase® Event
Stream Processor (SAP Sybase ESP). The SAP Integration and Certification Center
(SAP ICC) has certified that the Grok 2.0 solution integrates with the SAP
Sybase ESP 5.1 to send and receive streaming data, predictions, and anomalies
found in data streams.

Grok’s patented machine intelligence product ingests data streams and creates
actionable predictions and detects anomalies in real-time. The Grok solution
features automated pattern discovery and predictive modeling capabilities based
on its unique biologically inspired machine intelligence algorithm. Grok was
recently named as one of the Cool Vendors in Analytics for 2013 by Gartner
Research.

> **Grok delivers real-time predictions and finds anomalies in streaming data.**

“Grok’s ability to learn from streaming data makes it a perfect add-on for
customers who are looking to automatically and intelligently act on their
machine-generated data,” said Numenta CEO Rami Branitzky. “The Grok solution is
a natural complement to SAP Real-Time Data Platform. We look forward to working
closely with SAP to serve this rapidly expanding market.”

In addition, Numenta has applied to join the SAP PartnerEdge® program as an SAP
software solution and technology partner. Through the program, partners work
closely with [SAP AG](http://sap.com) (NYSE: SAP) to develop and
certify the technical integration of their solutions with SAP software.
Integrated partner applications extend, complement and add value to SAP
solutions, thereby helping mutual customers more successfully meet business
needs and drive strong results.

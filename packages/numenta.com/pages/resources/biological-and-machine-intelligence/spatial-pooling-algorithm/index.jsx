              Column: An HTM region is organized in columns of cells. The SP
              operates at the column-level, where a column of a cells function
              as a single computational unit.

              Start with an input consisting of a fixed number of bits. These
              bits might represent sensory data or they might come from
              another region elsewhere in the HTM system.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Initialize the HTM region by assigning a fixed number of columns
              to the region receiving this input. Each column has an
              associated dendritic segment, serving as the connection to the
              input space. Each dendrite segment has a set of potential
              synapses representing a (random) subset of the input bits. Each
              potential synapse has a permanence value. These values are
              randomly initialized around the permanence threshold. Based on
              their permanence values, some of the potential synapses will
              already be connected; the permanences are greater than than the

              For any given input, determine how many connected synapses on

            <ListItem>
              The number of active synapses is multiplied by a “boosting”

              A small percentage of columns within the inhibition radius with
              the highest activations (after boosting) become active, and
              disable the other columns within the radius. The inhibition
              radius is itself dynamically determined by the spread of input
              bits. There is now a sparse set of active columns.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The region now follows the Spatial Pooling (Hebbian-style)
              learning rule: For each of the active columns, we adjust the
              permanence values of all the potential synapses. The permanence
              values of synapses aligned with active input bits are increased.
              The permanence values of synapses aligned with inactive input
              bits are decreased. The changes made to permanence values may
              change some synapses from being connected to unconnected, and
              vice-versa.

            This section contains the detailed pseudocode for the Spatial
            Pooling function, broken down into four phases: initialization,
            overlap computation, inhibition, and learning. After
            initialization (phase 1), every iteration of the Spatial Pooling
            algorithm’s compute routine goes through three distinct phases
            (phase 2 through phase 4) that occur in sequence.

          <Paragraph>
            Prior to receiving any inputs, the Spatial Pooling algorithm is
            initialized by computing a list of initial potential synapses
            for each column. This consists of a random set of inputs
            selected from the input space (within a column’s inhibition
            radius). Each input is represented by a synapse and assigned a
            random permanence value. The random permanence values are chosen
            with two criteria. First, the values are chosen to be in a small
            range around connectedPerm, the minimum permanence value at
            which a synapse is considered "connected". This enables
            potential synapses to become connected (or disconnected) after a
            small number of training iterations. Second, each column has a
            natural center over the input region, and the permanence values
            have a bias towards this center, so that they have higher values
            near the center.

          <Paragraph>
            Given an input vector, this phase calculates the overlap of each
            column with that vector. The overlap for each column is simply the
            number of connected synapses with active inputs, multiplied by the
            column’s boost factor.

          <Paragraph>
            The third phase calculates which columns remain as winners after
            the inhibition step. localAreaDensity is a parameter that controls
            the desired density of active columns within a local inhibition
            area. Alternatively, the density can be controlled by parameter
            numActiveColumnsPerInhArea. When using this method, the
            localAreaDensity parameter must be less than 0. The inhibition
            logic will ensure that at most numActiveColumnsPerInhArea columns
            become active in each local inhibition area. For example, if
            numActiveColumnsPerInhArea is 10, a column will be a winner if it
            has a non-zero overlap and its overlap score ranks 10th or higher
            among the columns within its inhibition radius.

            This final phase performs learning, updating the permanence values
            of all synapses as necessary, as well as the boost values and
            inhibition radii. The main learning rule is implemented in lines
            14-20. For winning columns, if a synapse is active, its permanence
            value is incremented, otherwise it is decremented; permanence
            values are constrained to be between 0 and 1. Notice that
            permanence values on synapses of non-winning columns are not
            modified.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Lines 21-27 implement boosting. There are two separate mechanisms
            in place to help a column learn connections. If a column does not
            win often enough (as measured by activeDutyCycle) compared to its
            neighbors, its overall boost value is set to be greater than 1
            line 22-23). If a column is active more frequently than its
            neighbors, its overall boost value is set to be less than one. The
            boostFunction is an exponential function that depends on the
            difference between the active duty cycle of a column and the
            average active duty cycles of its neighbors. If a column's
            connected synapses do not overlap well with any inputs often
            enough (as measured by overlapDutyCycle), its permanence values
            are boosted (line 24-27). Note that once learning is turned off,
            boost(c) is frozen.

            Finally, at the end of Phase 4 the inhibition radius is recomputed

            The Spatial Pooling algorithm has many parameters that affect the
            dimensionality, learning mechanisms, and overall performance. Here
            we discuss some parameters in detail, and how various values
            influence Spatial Pooling. The roles of the parameters were
            previously described in the pseudocode, and a full list of the
            algorithm parameters, data structures, and routines can be found in
            Tables 1 and 2 below.

            Spatial Pooling Algorithm Structure
          </SubTitle>
          <Paragraph>
            The column dimensions (columnDimensions) as specified in the Spatial
            Pooling algorithm parameters define the dimensions for the HTM
            region. If we allocate 4096 columns, the region is an array of 4096
            columns. However, for a vision system, the same number of columns
            could be used as a two-dimensional array, so the region’s columnar
            structure would be 64x64. We can also specify a three-dimensional
            topology.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            While the column dimensions control the output shape, the inputs to
            the columns are controlled by specifying the Spatial Pooling
            algorithm’s input parameters. The input dimensions (inputDimensions)
            are specified just like the column dimensions, and the number of
            dimensions must match. The input space that a column can potentially
            connect to—i.e., the receptive field of the column—is controlled
            with the potential radius (potentialRadius) parameter. This value
            will determine the spread of a column’s influence across the HTM
            layer. A small potential radius will keep a column’s receptive field
            local, while a very large potential radius will give the column
            global coverage over the input space.

            Inhibition
          </SubTitle>
          <Paragraph>
            With global inhibition (globalInhibition=True), the most active
            columns are selected from the entire layer. Otherwise the winning
            columns are selected with respect to the columns’ local
            neighborhoods. The former offers a significant performance boost,
            and is often what we use in practice. With global inhibition turned
            off, the columnar inhibition takes effect in local neighborhoods.
            Column neighborhoods are a function of the inhibition radius
            (inhibitionRadius), a dynamically calculated measure internal to the
            Spatial Pooling algorithm that is a function of the average size of
            the connected receptive fields of all columns. The receptive field
            of columns can be controlled in part by the potential radius
            parameter above; it cannot be set explicitly because the receptive
            fields of Spatial Pooling algorithm columns (and HTM cells in
            general) are dynamic.

            We can however specify the density of active columns, with either
            localAreaDensity or numActiveColumnsPerInhArea. During inhibition
            these parameters will be used to calculate the maximum number of
            columns to remain ON within a local inhibition area. With the former
            parameter, you specify a density, so the actual number of active
            columns will change as columns’ change the sizes of their receptive
            fields. Using the latter parameter, the density will fluctuate as
            the receptive fields change, but the max number of active columns
            remains fixed.

          <Paragraph>
            Although a column may win out in competition, its activation must be
            greater than a threshold (stimulusThreshold) in order to become
            active. The intent here is to prevent noise from activating columns,
            which is helpful towards the spatial pooling goal of avoiding
            trivial patterns.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Boosting can be helpful in driving columns to compete for
            activation. Boosting is monitored by both the activity and overlap
            duty cycles
            activeDutyCycle(c) and overlapDutyCycle(c), respectively). Following
            inhibition, if a column’s active duty cycle falls below the active
            duty cycles of neighboring columns, then its internal boost factor
            (boost(c)) will increase above one. If a column's active duty cycle
            arises above the active duty cycles of neighboring columns, its
            boost factor will decrease below one This helps drive the
            competition amongst columns and achieve the spatial pooling goal of
            using all the columns. Before inhibition, if a column’s overlap duty
            cycle is below its minimum acceptable value calculated dynamically
            as a function of minPctOverlapDutyCycle and the overlap duty cycle
            of neighboring columns), then all its permanence values are boosted
            by the increment amount. A subpar duty cycle implies either a
            column's previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or the
            vast majority of them have been "hijacked" by other columns. By
            raising all synapse permanences in response to a subpar duty cycle
            before inhibition, we enable a column to search for new inputs.

                  scalar value. It is above one if the active duty cycle is
                  above
                  the
                  mean active duty cycles of neighboring columns. It is less
                  than
                  one
                  if a column has higher active duty cycle than its neighbors

title: What is aggregation and how does HTM Studio use it?
---

Aggregation refers to the process of combining multiple values over a given
period of time. This can be very useful if you are collecting data at a high
frequency or if you have noisy data.  Aggregating can reduce the amount of noise
and help the HTM model learn faster. HTM Studio determines whether and how much
to aggregate the input records before feeding them into the HTM model.

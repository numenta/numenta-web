title: How do I choose the best aggregation window?
---

The ideal aggregation window is one that allows you to aggregate as much as you
can but not too much. There is no one-size-fits-all value, as aggregation is
application-dependent. HTM Studio makes a good first guess with any data set,
but getting the best aggregation possible requires knowledge about the
application itself. HTM Studio defaults to an automated technique that
determines a best-effort aggregation window for your data. However, you can
change the value of the aggregation window (or choose to not aggregate the data
at all) in “advanced settings” when you create a new model. For more information

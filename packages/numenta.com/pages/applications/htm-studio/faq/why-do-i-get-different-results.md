title: Why do I get different results with different aggregation settings?
---

When you aggregate your data, you are changing the number of data points that
HTM sees.  In some cases, aggregating your data may cause you to miss anomalies
and in other cases, it may help you find anomalies by tuning out noise. The goal
is to aggregate your data as much as possible but not too much. You can
experiment with different aggregation windows in HTM Studio to see how it
changes your results.  To see an example, [click here](/applications/htm-studio/aggregation/).

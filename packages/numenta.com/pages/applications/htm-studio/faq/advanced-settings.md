title: What are the advanced settings for?

HTM Studio determines the optimal parameters for each Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) model and in some cases, aggregates your data for analysis. You can
see what these parameters are in the advanced settings. We recommend that you
follow the determined parameters for the best possible analysis. However, you
may modify these parameters by clicking the advanced settings. For example, you
can change the aggregation method and period. Or you can also suppress data
aggregation by disabling the check box. See question “What does aggregate my
data mean?” for information on aggregating data.

Numenta is a small team of scientists and engineers working on one of science’s
grand challenges: how the brain works and how brain principles will be used in
Machine Intelligence.

### What We Do

We are reverse engineering the neocortex. We publish our progress in scientific
journals and create software simulations to test our theories. Everything we do
is publicly disclosed and available in an open source form.

### Our Business

We have built a large IP/patent portfolio. We offer several types of licenses.
Our IP will become increasingly essential as machine learning and AI adopt brain
principles.

### Our Progress

We have made several fundamental discoveries so far. These include:

- How neurons make predictions and detect anomalies.
- How layers of neurons learn sequences of patterns.
- How multiple layers of neurons learn to recognize objects via movement.

### Our Latest Discovery: Sensorimotor Integration

In 2016 we discovered a “missing ingredient”. All areas of the neocortex assign
their input to a “location" in the external world. This explains how we learn
through movement and perceive a rich model of the world and the objects in it.
This is a major addition to existing neuroscience thinking and it will have a
large impact on how we design intelligent machines.

### What It Means For Machine Intelligence

Today’s machine learning technologies are extremely limited compared to human
intelligence. To overcome these limitations, intelligent machines need to work
on the same principles as the brain. Intelligent machines patterned after the
brain will be able to solve many important problems. Numenta is far ahead of any
other team in this effort to create true machine intelligence.

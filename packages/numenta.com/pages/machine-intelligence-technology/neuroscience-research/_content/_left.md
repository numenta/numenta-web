Reverse engineering the neocortex to figure out how the brain works is one of
humanity's grand scientific challenges. We are fortunate to be living in an era
when neuroscience techniques are advancing at an amazing pace, giving rise to a
wealth of data on everything from synapses, to neurons, to entire cortical
regions. Our research team focuses on theory. We work with experimentalists and
published results to derive an understanding of what the neocortex does and how
the detailed architecture of the neocortex implements this. We test our theories
via simulation, mathematical analysis, and experimental partnerships. While
there are many experimental neuroscience laboratories, Numenta is unique in its
focus on large-scale cortical theory and simulation.

Although there is much to do, we have made significant progress on several key
aspects of cortical theory. Our first focus was on how the neocortex learns the
structure in streams of sensory data. This led to a comprehensive theory of why
neurons in the neocortex have thousands of synapses and active dendrites, and
why they are arranged in minicolumns as observed in the neocortex. We have taken
this theoretical advance and applied it to commercially valuable problems in
anomaly detection and prediction in streaming data. To further that goal we
created  a [benchmark for anomaly detection in streaming data][nab] that for the
first  time provided a means for comparing the results of different algorithms
for anomaly detection. Our current research focus is developing a comprehensive
theory of how the neocortex learns through movement — what is often called
“sensorimotor” learning.

We document our research in several ways,
including [peer-reviewed journal papers][papers], conference proceedings,
research reports, [invited talks][events], and a living book titled [BAMI][bami]
(Biological and Machine Intelligence). In addition, we place all of our
software, from our commercial grade applications to our daily research commits,
in our open source project, [NuPIC][org]. We strive to be completely open in
everything we do.

We welcome collaborations with both neuroscientists and machine learning
researchers. We also encourage you to apply to
our [Visiting Scholar Program][visit].

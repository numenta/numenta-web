We are now accepting technical intern applications for the Fall - Winter
2016/2017 and Summer 2017 time frames.

We have two types of technical internships at Numenta: Algorithms and Software
Engineering. While the two internships have a somewhat different focus, and
therefore different requirements, all of Numenta’s technical interns will get
exposure to the HTM learning algorithms and our streaming analytics platform.
The commitment is for 3 to 4 months, full time.

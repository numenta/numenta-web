## I’m new to HTM. Where can I learn more about it?

A great place to start is [HTM School](/htm-school/),
an educational YouTube series. The series is designed to be viewed in
order, with each episode explaining fundamental concepts. HTM School is
aimed at a general audience. If you’re looking for more technical
detail, you can view [Numenta's technical papers](http://numenta.com/papers/).

## How can I join the HTM open source community?

There are many ways to get involved, but the first step is to join the
[HTM Forum,](https://discourse.numenta.org/categories) which is where
you can introduce yourself, ask questions, find information and connect
with others interested in and working on HTM. You can also join our
[Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Numenta-Platform-for-Intelligent-Computing-Events/)
and subscribe to our [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/c/NumentaOrg)

## Where can I find the code?

You can find
Numenta's [production](https://github.com/numenta) and
[research](https://github.com/numenta/htmresearch) code (and more) on
[Github](https://github.com/numenta/). Community members often share their
projects on [HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/categories) or
[HTM Community](https://github.com/htm-community) Github.

## What implementations are available?

We have multiple [HTM implementations](/implementations/)
available. Numenta maintains and supports one in Python with C++. Community
members have contributed implementations in languages such as Java, Clojure,
Go, and JavaScript.

## What are the licensing options?

Our open source code containing intellectual property is governed by
an [AGPL Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)
license. For those who are unable to use AGPLv3, we offer a
[trial license](/licenses/trial/), and for those interested
in distributing the technology, we offer
[commercial licenses](http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/apps/licensing-guide.pdf).
You can read more about our licenses [here](/licenses/).

## Is there a specific application for HTM?

The algorithm lends itself well to high-speed temporal data, but it
could potentially be applied to many different fields and endeavors.
Have an idea? Discuss HTM applications on
[HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/c/htm-hackers).

## What is the current research focus for HTM?

Numenta’s current focus is developing a comprehensive theory of how the
neocortex learns through movement — what is often called “sensorimotor”
learning. You can view a recording of Numenta Open Source Community
Manager Matt Taylor talking with Jeff Hawkins about this topic in this
[video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDrlePl0jUIZWKwQwUgOfxA-&v=fNc73-tHHgY).

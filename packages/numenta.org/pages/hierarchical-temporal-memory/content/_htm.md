Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically-constrained theory of
intelligence originally described in the book **On Intelligence<**. HTM is
not a Deep Learning or Machine Learning technology. HTM is a machine
intelligence framework strictly based on neuroscience and the physiology and
interaction of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex of the mammalian brain.

For detailed information — including educational videos, papers,
and community discussions — regarding HTM, please see our [HTM School][school].

To get an idea of how HTM theory originated, you can read about the creation of
the Redwood Neuroscience center and Numenta at [HTM History][history].

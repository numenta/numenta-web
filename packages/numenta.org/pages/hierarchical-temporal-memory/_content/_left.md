Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically-constrained theory of
intelligence originally described in the book [On Intelligence][book].
HTM is not a Deep Learning or Machine Learning technology. It is a machine
intelligence framework strictly based on neuroscience and the physiology and
interaction of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex of the mammalian brain.

If youâ€™re interested in learning more about HTM, visit our
educational series [HTM School][school] or browse through the topics
on [HTM Forum][forum]. You can also find a collection of research papers at
http://numenta.com/papers/ and a living book authored by Numenta researchers and
engineers that documents HTM
called [Biological and Machine Intelligence (BAMI)][bami].

title: NuPIC Tooling

Looks like you've found our tools page. It's not linked from anywhere, so you
must be exploring. Well, here are some tools we use:

* [NuPIC Contributors][1]
* [NuPIC Committers][2]
* [Re-validate all open NuPIC Pull Requests][3]

By the way, since you seem interested, you can see the source code for our
projects [on github][4]. Would you like to [help us maintain it][5]?

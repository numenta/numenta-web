In addition to making all of Numenta's [production][github]
and [research][research] code open source, our community produces and shares
HTM implementations and applications, commonly posting their projects
on [HTM Forum][forum]. Our community hosts many of these projects on
the [HTM Community][community] Github organization. We
have [HTM implementations][implements] in languages like Python, C++, Java,
Clojure, Go, and JavaScript.

We are always looking for community members that can help others build out HTM
applications and experiments. If you are interested in helping or providing
consulting services, please leave us a note on the [HTM Hackers Forum][hack] and
introduce yourself.

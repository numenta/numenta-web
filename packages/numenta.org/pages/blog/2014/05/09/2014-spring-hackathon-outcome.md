We had a **great** hackathon event this past weekend. This was our third
hackathon, and it resulted in the most hackers, the most hacks, and the most
productive environment yet. Even if you could not attend, I hope the videos and
photographs below help you to understand NuPIC better by example.

The hackathon brought in attendees from all over the world. We started at 10AM
on Saturday with a kickoff presentation, helped people get NuPIC installed, then
held several [informational sessions](#sessions) throughout the day. Breakfast,
lunch, and dinner were served.

Big thanks to [Pinger](http://pinger.com), who graciously donated their space to
us for the event!

## Testimonials

Everyone seemed to have a great time, and most people stuck around through the
event (sans some sleep time!) to see the demos at the end.

> *"Another outstanding event! Thanks Numenta!"*
  —**Jeff Fohl**

> *"Learned a ton, great people, great numenta staff, matt++ :)"*
  —**Wade Hought**

> *"It was great to meet the community and to exchange ideas"*
  —**Francisco Webber (CEPT)**

> *"Comparing with the Fall 2013: 1. More people with serious interest in the
  NuPIC/Theory, 2. More hacks worked on and presented, 3. Previous "hacks"
  extended (CEPT!), 4. Theory has made progress towards deeper understanding of
  brain. Great to see the people from Numenta, the previous event, and new
  people with practical interest!"*
  —**Azat**

> *"Really great, even better than in the Fall. Thanks to everyone who worked
  really hard to make the hackathon go so smoothly, and to all who took part.
  It was a real pleasure to meet so many smart people, all interested in
  furthering Machine Intelligence."*
  —**Fergal Byrne**


## Kickoff

Where hackers are welcomed to the hackathon, protocol is reviewed, and ideas are
brainstormed.

## Sessions

Just like [last hackathon](/blog/2013/11/06/2013-fall-hackathon-outcome/),
we had several presentations from NuPIC engineers for hackathon participants to
attend, if wanted. You can also view them
[all in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE4yp2vePA8&list=PL3yXMgtrZmDoHTTIqUYHT3pTrw0dbb1FQ).

#### NuPIC Beginner Guide

A detailed introduction to the components of NuPIC. Includes encoders, the
spatial pooler, and swarming. Contains live code running in an iPython Notebook,
which is included as a reference.

## Demos

We had a **lot of demos** at this hackathon! In addition to the
[full playlist of all our hackathon demonstrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT9DPlat-Nw&amp;list=PL3yXMgtrZmDpMeCpPoJf7iMO2lHTTSvd-),
I've broken out each hack below with further information about the participants
and source code (if available).

## Conclusion

This was our most successful hackathon yet. Thanks to everyone who participating
in the event, helped out with the planning and execution, and even for those of
you watching the videos now. I hope you'll considering attending our next
hackathon!

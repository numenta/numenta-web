On October 18-19 of 2014, we held our fourth NuPIC Hackathon in San Jose at
[Pinger, Inc](http://pinger.com). It was a 36-hour event, starting at 10AM on
Saturday, and ending with hack demos at 4PM Sunday afternoon. We started with a
Kickoff presentation to go over hackathon protocol, then jumped right into
hacking. There were some interesting themes this time. A lot more people tried
using [cortical.io](http://cortical.io)'s word fingerprinting service for
natural language processing hacks. We also had a lot of interest in EEG analysis
with NuPIC, which seems to be a hot topic within the community. And we even had
another robotics demo!

I think I say this after every NuPIC hackathon we host, but this hackathon was
the best one yet! We had well over 50 participants, 16 demos, and a ton of fun
and community bonding. It was really nice to see some new faces at this
hackathon. I love meeting the people of our community!

on YouTube.**

Once again, we had attendees from all over the world: Amsterdam, China, Austria,
Ireland, not to mention from all over the United States. I was really impressed
how with each hackathon our community gets a better understanding of NuPIC and
how it can be used to tackle many different kinds of problems. Even though we
had a high percentage of new hackers this time, I could really see the light
bulbs turning on as I talked to people about their hackathon ideas.

## Testimonials

More people than ever, and a more diverse community than ever. We had pro
hackers, students, software professionals, a neurologist, and even some new to
programming in general.

## Sessions

We only gave a few presentations from Numenta and friends for hackathon
participants to attend in order to give more time for attendees to work on their
projects. You can watch all the recordings we took at the hackathon
[in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDo4uTtO8Fqialyf6O1szHaT).

#### Hackathon Kickoff

Where hackers are welcomed to the hackathon, protocol is reviewed, and ideas are
brainstormed.

* Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/numenta/2014-fall-nupic-hackathon-kickoff
* Presenters: Matt Taylor &amp; Jeff Hawkins

#### EEGs &amp; NuPIC Demo

We had a neurologist attending the hackathon, who was kind enough to sit in
front of a camera for us and let us pick his brain about EEGs.

* Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbNbaBtxr4
* Presenter: Dr. Richard Pantera

#### Language Intelligence

"On the Way to Language Intelligence" by http://cortical.io.

Francisco talks about language, intelligence, and cortical.io's new REST API
version 2.0 and all its capabilities.

* Presenter: Francisco Webber, http://cortical.io

#### Applications of HTM

This talk is from the Numenta Workshop that preceeded the hackathon, but Chetan
gave the same talk at the hackathon. Since the recording at the workshop was a
better quality than the hackathon presentation, I've included the first one.

* Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=900nFOfzp2E
* Presenter: Chetan Surpur, Numenta Engineer

#### Q&amp;A with Jeff Hawkins

Jeff Hawkins takes questions about HTM theory from hackathon attendees and
explains the answers in front of a whiteboard.

## Demos

Games, physics, robotics, geology, natural language, geospatial analysis...
demos at this hackathon spanned a large breadth of topics. We were really
impressed with the types of things hackers attempted to perform with NuPIC. When
we have hackathons, it's a chance for people interested in NuPIC and HTM to push
the boundaries of HTM technology and really see what it might be capable of. I
always come away inspired and excited about the future of NuPIC and HTM, and
this hackathon was no exception at all.

Not all hacks are success stories, but each one is a learning experience. We'll
never know what can be achieved with cortically-inspired machine intelligence
unless we try to solve hard problems.

#### Pendulum

#### MineHack

I created a Minecraft mod that exports player X,Y,Z coordinates into NuPIC using
the CoordinateEncoder to get anomaly indications for a live player.

#### Shake Hack

According to recent news, the Bay Area is overdue another "Big One".  I'll be
evaluating encoding schemes for data that comprises the last 10+ years of
magnitude 2.5 or greater earthquake activity for the 1000 km radius centered on
the Pinger headquarters in San Jose, CA. I'm hoping to identify earthquake
swarms leading up to larger events in the same region.

#### Semantic Fingerprint Sentence Generation

In this hack, we will attempt to generate semantic fingerprints from WordNet
semantic relationships and train the HTM to recognize sequences of meaning from
training texts.  The trained HTM will be used to generate English sentences by
using the predicted sequence of SDRs from the HTM to select words from the
training set to fill in blanks in the sentences generated according to a limited
English grammar.

#### NuPIC EEG

Nicolas used his hack to work on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction),
and the rules of the competition prevent us from displaying his video or source
code until the competition is over.

#### AutoDJ

I'm extracting my track-by-track music listening history from Last.fm and then
seeing if NUPIC can predict what artist I'm going to listen to next given a
sequence of my previous listens.

## Conclusion

As the NuPIC community grows, I continue to be awed and inspired by its passion
and perseverance. A sincere thank you to all who have participated on our
mailing lists, our code repositories, and our hackathons. You folks are the
reason we've gone open source, and the reason we continue to thrive. I see a
bright future for us, and I truly believe we will lead the path forward to truly
intelligent machines built on neocortical principles.

It's not an easy road, but you are the **pioneers** helping us pave it for the
masses that will follow. I had a wonderful time interacting with all of you, and
I look forward to even more ground-breaking work at the next hackathon in
Spring 2015.

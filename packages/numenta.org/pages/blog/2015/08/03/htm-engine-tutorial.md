Numenta recently open-sourced a bunch of product code at:
<https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps>. This includes the code for our most
recent product, [HTM for Stocks](https://numenta.com/htm-for-stocks), and it
also includes an extremely useful utility for running many anomaly detection
models simultaneously called
**[HTM Engine](https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps/tree/master/htmengine)**.

The **HTM Engine** can be a bit tricky to get running by yourself, so I created
[a tutorial screencast](https://youtu.be/lzJd_a6y6-E) that shows how you can
build your own client program that uses the HTM Engine in any programming
environment you like.

This screencast showcases a prototype JavaScript application I wrote that pulls
live traffic speeds from
[153 routes in and around New York City](http://data.numenta.org/nyc-traffic/keys.html)
and feeds them into NuPIC models simultaneously.

I hope you find this screencast useful. Please let me know if you have any
troubles getting it running by emailing at <matt@numenta.org>, or just send your
message to the `nupic-discuss` mailing list.

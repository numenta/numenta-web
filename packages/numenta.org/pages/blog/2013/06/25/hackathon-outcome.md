The first NuPIC Hackathon occurred over the past weekend, ending with eight demo
applications from ten different participants. Even though there were some
struggles getting NuPIC building and running on different platforms (we
anticipated that), I consider this event a success based on the number of
demonstrations ready within 24 hours.

We had a great group of participants in attendance. Thank you all for coming,
especially those of you who stuck it out all night and produced demos! We had
hackers fly in from **Seattle**, **St. Louis**, **Memphis**, and **Mexico**...
not to mention those attending from the San Francisco bay area.

The event was live-streamed on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-ttzWLgXZOGuhUyrPlUuA). All the
individual videos are linked below, but the most interesting videos are the
**kickoff** and the **demonstrations** at the end.


## Kickoff Video

## Many Hours of Hacking

An awful lot of interesting conversations occurred. If you jump into any of the
following videos, you might happen upon something intriguing. Of course, you
might also see us falling asleep in our coffees at 3am.

easier for you to navigate by project. I've linked each demo individually below.

## Thank you!

We were so happy with the hacks, we gave everyone who came up with one a
[raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (and we'll be working on getting
NuPIC to build on one!)

We had a great time hosting this hackathon, and we can't wait to do it again.
Additionally, we got really valuable feedback from all the participants on how
we can improve NuPIC for all our users and contributors. Don't doubt that we'll
be taking all your comments and critiques into consideration as we continue to
mature our open source offering.

If you are interesting in joining our next hackathon, please
[visit our community forum](https://discourse.numenta.org), where we'll continue
to post notifications about future events.

We're having a NuPIC Hackathon on June 21, and we have about five spaces
available for more participants. *First come, first served!* It will be in the
San Francisco Bay Area. If you are interested in attending, please contact me
directly at <matt@numenta.org>.

This stuff is not easy. The Cortical Learning Algorithm is based on novel
concepts that present a steep learning curve. I'd recommend you have at least
one of the following qualities before you contact me to attend. If you have
both, then you're our target market for this Hackathon, and you should seriously
think about coming!

- Familiarity with the [CLA white paper](/resources/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf)
- Programming skills with C++ or python

The event will kick off with a short message from Jeff Hawkins, founder of
Numenta and author of **On Intelligence**. Afterwards, there will be a technical
introduction to the [NuPIC codebase](http://github.com/numenta/nupic), along
with an example application and some guidance for participants.

During the event, CLA experts will be available to help hackers work with the
NuPIC library.

At 5PM on Saturday June 22, participants will have the chance to showcase their
work before the group. The best entries will receive prizes!

There will be pizza and beer available Friday night, coffee Saturday morning,
and sandwiches Saturday for lunch.

*Technical requirements:* linux (but we'll have VMs available if you only have a
Windows laptop), python 2.6, gcc.

At [OSCON 2013](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013) this past July, the Numenta team
had the opportunity to give two presentations about cortical learning algorithms
and NuPIC. Jeff Hawkins gave a short keynote talk entitled
[On Open Intelligence](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/130998),
which created a decent amount of conversation. OSCON has provided a
[great video of Jeff's keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_eT5bsS4bQ).

Here are some twitter reactions to Jeff's talk:

> *Very interesting talk on @numenta - Now I need to read the white paper
  #oscon*
  —**Carin Meier (@carinmeier)**

> *Just listened to Jeff Hawkins talk about neuroscience. Keynotes at @oscon
  are always so awesome.*
  —**Rich Bowen (@rbowen)**

> *First speaker Jeff Hawkins is one of my heroes! Author of “On Intelligence”
  #OSCON (also Palm Pilot pioneer)*
  —**Morris Mojo Jones (@mojo_la)**

> *Very rarely have I seen a room of geeks as captivated as they are by this
  talk from Jeff Hawkins #oscon*
  —**paris b-a (@parisba)**

> *Jeff Hawkins/NuPIC and Dancing Robots are tops for #OSCON keynotes this year.
  All were good, those were fascinating.*
  —**Dave Mcallister (@dwmcallister)**

There was a lot of interest in the brain-inspired technology behind NuPIC, as
depicted in this
[blog post](http://www.jeffkramer.com/2013/07/29/oscon-2013-the-source-must-flow/):

> *The most interesting keynote, though, was from Numenta.  ... The science is
  beyond me, but the demo and keynote was great, and you can (should) watch it
  on YouTube.  I went to their panel later, and they recommended Jeff’s book On
  Intelligence as a primer for those interested.  There are code samples (in
  Python!) with the NuPIC library up on their github account.*

Soon after Jeff's talk, [Carin Meier](https://twitter.com/carinmeier) presented
about [The Joy of Flying Robots with Clojure](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29559),
and of course the audience made some typical associations.

> *Anybody else think it&#39;s a good idea to keep @carinmeier and Jeff Hawkins
  @numenta away from each other? #sentientrobots #OSCON*
  —**Pete Johnson (@nerdguru)**

> *&quot;I, for one, welcome our new machine intelligence overlords&quot; Check
  out #NuPic at #OSCON from Jeff Hawkins Numenta.org.*
  —**Dave Mcallister (@dwmcallister)**

> *You asked for it! Here&#39;s Jeff Hawkins and Carin Meier plotting world
  post-keynote domination #NuPIC #oscon #numenta.*
  —**Danese Cooper (@DivaDanese)**

Scott and I also presented
[a technical session](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/30342)
about [NuPIC](/). OSCON staff have not made the video available yet, but it is
supposed to be available sometime in November.

After the session, the Q/A was running long, so we stayed around and answered
questions in the hallway for another 30 minutes. As portrayed in
[an attendee's blog post](http://blog.profitbricks.com/oscon-keynote-day-1-recap/),
*"the line to talk to Jeff and his engineers afterward was 7 people deep at
least."*

At some point during the conference, Simon Phipps from
[Twit.tv](http://twit.tv/floss259) pulled Jeff aside and recorded
[this interview with him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V08QmAz9MyI).

We also had the opportunity to hold a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session, which
drew around 30 people and lasted for over 90 minutes. Although I hadn't thought
of recording this session, a persistent community member (you know who you are)
prodded me into an ad-hoc A/V session, and I managed to get a
[somewhat-digestible video online](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2Vtom3TcU).

Sorry for the awful audio, but this was my first ad-hoc live-streaming
experience. I promise, it will be better next time!

All-in-all, OSCON was great fun and a wonderful way to spread the word about
NuPIC and our open source community. We even got a chance to meet a few friends
from our mailing list who lived in the Portland area. Thanks to everyone who
made it to the BOF sessions and showed interested in our technology.

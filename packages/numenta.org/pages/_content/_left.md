## Machine Intelligence Starts Here

[Hierarchical Temporal Memory][htm] is a foundational technology for the future
of machine intelligence based upon the biology of the neocortex. Because Numenta
is committed to making this technology accessible to everyone, all HTM software
and ongoing research is open source. This allows you to work with our technology
in whatever way works best for you ‒ learn about the theory, dive into the
source code, or start your own implementation. Some of our community members
have written their own versions of HTM systems in other languages and platforms.
Others have created detailed visualizations, experiments, and applications.

The neocortex is a logical system that we'll understand fully in time. HTM
theory reflects our current understanding of how the neocortex works, and HTM
code reduces that theory to practice. HTM is continually being updated as we
learn more about the brain. We believe HTM will play a critical role in the
creation of truly intelligent machines.

## Join us!

There are many ways for you to get involved. Come discuss HTM theory with
us [on our forums][forum], or share your HTM application on
our [Github organization][github]. If you're new to HTM, a great place to learn
is in [HTM School][school]. We hope you’ll join our community and help us
discover the future of machine intelligence.

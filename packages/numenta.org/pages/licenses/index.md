title: Numenta Licenses

## Summary

Our core algorithms are [AGPL Version 3][1], but there are ways you can
experiment with our technology without being constrained. We offer both a
[commercial license option][2] and a [trial license][3],
which allows you to experiment temporarily without affecting your codebase with
the AGPL, giving you time to decide whether a commercial license is worth it.
To learn more about the kinds of commercial licenses we offer, download our
[License Guide][4].

* NuPIC and associated applications of NuPIC at <http://github.com/numenta> are
  licensed as dual commercial and [AGPL version 3][1]

* [Commercial licenses][2] are also available from Numenta

The goal of the license is to require that enhancements to NuPIC be released to
the community.

## Patents

Our CEO, Donna Dubinsky, wrote a blog post about our [Patent Position][5].

## Contributor License

Are you interested in [getting involved][6] in this project? You'll first have
to sign the [Contributor License][7].

## Trial License

In order to experiment with our technology without the constraints of the AGPL,
you may sign up for our [trial license][3]. This will allow you to work
under a temporary license and create a proof-of-concept and decide later whether
to convert to a commercial license or go AGPL.

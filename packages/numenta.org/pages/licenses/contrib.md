<p></p>

Although most open source projects refer to a "Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)", we have chosen to refer to this agreement as Numenta's "Contributor
License (CL)" to prevent confusion between it and the Cortical Learning
Algorithm (CLA) referenced in our source code and documentation.

### Please read and sign the Numenta Contributor License below:
